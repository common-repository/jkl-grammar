# JKL Grammar

`Version 1.1.0`

* [Plugin Page](https://github.com/jekkilekki/plugin-jkl-grammar)
* [Author Page](https://aaron.kr/)

A simple plugin that adds a "Grammar" Custom Post Type to better organize grammar points for language learning blogs and sites.

## Description

Requires WordPress 3.5 and PHP 5.5 or later.

This plugin was built for my own Korean language learning site (keytokorean.com) to enable me to better organize the grammar points I'm studying. It includes the following taxonomies:

1. Level (Beginner, etc)
2. Book (Seoul University, Korean Grammar in Use, etc)
3. Part of Speech (Verb, Noun, etc)
4. Expression (frustation, excitement, etc)
5. Usage (formal, written, spoken, etc)

__Tested with__

* [TwentySixteen Theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/) 
* [TwentySeventeen Theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyseventeen/)

__Supported plugins__

* [WP Subtitle](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-subtitle/) - Changes metabox name from "Subtitle" to "Translation"

### Planned Upcoming Features 

I'm looking into adding "subtitle" support that would let me put the Title in Korean and the subtitle in English. But we'll use this for a while and see how I'm actually putting it to use and what kinds of things I feel are still needed before laying out a roadmap for future development.

1. ReactJS Archive (index) page (filterable)
2. Gutenberg block for (something?) sentences, or usage, or notes, or something?

### Translations

* English (EN) - default
* Korean (KO) - upcoming

If you want to help translate the plugin into your language, please have a look at the `.pot` file which contains all definitions and may be used with a [gettext] editor.

If you have created your own language pack, or have an update of an existing one, you can send your [gettext .po or .mo file] to me so that I can bundle it in the plugin.

### FAQs

#### Tips

As a general rule, it is always best to keep your WordPress installation and all Themes and Plugins fully updated in order to avoid problems with this or any other Themees or Plugins. I regularly update my site and test my Plugins and Themes with the latest version of WordPress.

#### When I select something from the dropdown menus on the archive page, I get a 404 error.

Please navigate to your WordPress Dashboard, go to `Settings -> Permalinks` and click the "Save" button. You just need to "flush" the permalink rewrite rules in this way.

#### Can you ADD / REMOVE / CHANGE features of the plugin?

Sure, I'm always open to suggestions. Let me know what you're looking for. Feel free to open a GitHub Issue on the [plugin repository](https://github.com/jekkilekki/plugin-jkl-grammar/issues) to let me know the specific features or problems you're having.
